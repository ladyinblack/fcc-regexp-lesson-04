## PROBLEM EXPLANATION
When creating a regular expression, you might want to match parts of string that are same ins pelling, but different in case.  To do this, you add the `i` flag to the end of the regex.  In this challenge, you are doing just that.

## HINTS
Modify the regex so that it detects "freeCodeCamp", "FREECODECAMP", and "FrEeCoDeCaMp".  Maybe using the `i` flag might help?
